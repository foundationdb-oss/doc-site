## What is FoundationDB?

FoundationDB is a distributed database designed to handle large volumes of structured data across clusters of commodity servers. It organizes data as an ordered key-value store and employs ACID transactions for all operations.

**Key features:**

- :white_check_mark: **ACID transactions** across the entire cluster
- :white_check_mark: **Horizontal scaling** to hundreds of nodes
- :white_check_mark: **High availability** with automatic failover
- :white_check_mark: **Low latency** for both reads and writes

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A supported operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows)
- At least 1GB of RAM available
- Network connectivity (for cluster deployments)

## Next Steps
